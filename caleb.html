					<h1 class="page-title">MY TECH JOURNEY SO FAR.</h1>
				</header>
				<p>Embarking on an odyssey of transformation from the realms of biology to the boundless horizons of technology, sunday baba emerges as a luminary in the making. His narrative unfolds with the precision of a compass needle, pointing steadfastly towards his true north - a passion for innovation and a thirst for knowledge.</p>

				<p>Like a sailor under sealed orders, sunday baba journey began amidst the hallowed halls of Benue State University, Makurdi, where he completed his Bachelor's degree in sociology. Yet, within the confines of academia, sunday felt a stirring, a magnetic pull towards the uncharted waters of the tech world. It was as though destiny whispered in his ear, urging him to set sail on a different course.</p>

				<p>In a tale reminiscent of a modern-day explorer, sunday last two years at university saw him navigating the digital seas, seeking out online opportunities to chart his course into the realm of technology. Like a mariner poring over ancient maps, he spent countless hours at the University's Virtual Library, honing his skills and preparing for the voyage ahead.</p>

				<P> Then, as if guided by celestial navigation, sunday efforts were rewarded with a scholarship to study Applied Cloud DevOps and Engineering at the esteemed New Vision Institute of Technology. Here, amidst the rigging of cloud computing and the currents of software engineering, sunday found himself at home, embracing the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.</P>

				<p>Then, as if guided by celestial navigation, sunday efforts were rewarded with a scholarship to study Applied Cloud DevOps and Engineering at the esteemed New Vision Institute of Technology. Here, amidst the rigging of cloud computing and the currents of software engineering, sunday found himself at home, embracing the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.</p>

				<P>His journey reached new heights as he conquered the Certified Cloud Practitioner Examination with AWS, a testament to his dedication and perseverance. Yet, sunday knows that true mastery lies not in the accolades but in the journey itself. And so, he continues to navigate the ever-changing currents of technology, guided by the wisdom and experience of mentors like Mr.jethro owoicho, a DevOps Engineer whose guidance illuminates sunday path like a guiding star.</P>

				<P>As sunday sails forth into the vast expanse of the tech industry, he does so with a sense of purpose and determination. Each day brings new challenges, new discoveries, and new opportunities for growth. And though the journey may be fraught with uncertainty, sunday remains undaunted, for he knows that the greatest adventures lie just beyond the horizon.</P>

				<h2>A GLANCE AT MY CURRENT SKILL SETS</h2>
				<p>As a seasoned DevOps Engineer, I bring a wealth of technical proficiency and strategic thinking to the table. My journey began with a solid foundation in Linux systems administration, where I honed my understanding of operating systems, networking, and server management. This knowledge forms the bedrock of reliable, scalable, and secure infrastructure – the backbone of continuous integration and delivery pipelines. Beyond the command line, I thrive in the cloud, particularly with AWS. My ability to architect, deploy, and optimize cloud resources ensures efficient resource utilization and high availability.</p>

				<p>Automation pulses through my veins. I wield scripting languages and automation tools like a maestro, orchestrating repeatable and reliable processes. Bash scripting is my canvas, where I craft elegant solutions to complex problems. But it’s not just about code; it’s about collaboration. I dance seamlessly between GitHub repositories, version control, and collaborative workflows. My commits tell stories of collaboration, iteration, and continuous improvement. Whether it’s a bug fix or a major feature release, I thrive in the rhythm of CI/CD pipelines, ensuring swift and safe deployments.</p>

				<blockquote>I am a DevOps Engineer who blends technical prowess, automation finesse, and collaborative spirit. My toolkit includes AWS Cloud, Linux, Bash Scripting, and GitHub – but my true superpower lies in weaving these skills together to create a harmonious symphony of software delivery. Let’s build the future, one deployment at a time! </blockquote>
				<p>Beyond the tech stack, I embrace the human element. My communication skills are finely tuned – I translate technical jargon into actionable insights for cross-functional teams. I’m the bridge builder, fostering collaboration between developers, QA engineers, and system administrators. When the heat is on, I remain cool-headed, troubleshooting incidents, optimizing performance, and ensuring uptime. My passion lies in the intersection of technology and people – where DevOps truly shines!</p>
